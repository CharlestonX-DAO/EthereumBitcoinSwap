7 tickets, ticket 2 is reserved and claimable.
The password to unlock the keystore is 'test'.  The keystore for address cd2a...
is not committed.

Here's how to create the tx to reserve the ticket:
send funds to intermediate address then:
python btcToEther.py makeAndSignTx 12.34 0.0017 mvBWJFv8Uc84YEyZKBm8HZQ7qrvmBiH7zR  cd2a3d9f938e13cd947ec05abc7fe734df8dd826

block 486842
tx hash dd5a8f13c97c8b8d47329fa7bd487df24b7d3b7e855a65eb7fd51e8f94f7e482

deployBtcTestnet (in btcrelay repo) works, note the 0x in the -a flag though:
pyepm -a 0x82a978b3f5962a5b0957d9ee9eef472ee55b42f1 deploy/testnet/deployBtcTestnet.yaml
pyepm version 7b7598e (branch fork/twoWaitTx) and Serpent 1.8.2 (e7b16fc) needed.
The deploy also works with testrpc d9e1ed0.

1. to debug verifyTx, update verifyTxForDebug.py then run deployDebug.yaml
1. with the contract address, replace setRelayToDebugContract.yaml and the dbgAddress variable in claimTicket.js
1. run setRelayToDebugContract.yaml
1. update dbgVerifyTx() txHash variable in claimTicket.js if needed
1. claim the ticket and watch what is fired
